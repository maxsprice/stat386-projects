# Web Scraping Data

There are millions of websites across the internet full of information. Often times, we read these websites and see some cool data shared by the writer. Being statisticians, it'd be pretty cool to have a tool that would allow us to access this data. That's where API Keys and Web Scraping comes in. Using either one of these tools we can pull data from a website for our own analysis. This Blog will focus on how to use web scraping to pull this data, and go through each step involved in this process.

### 1. Determine if pulling this data is ethical

To start, we need to determine if pulling this data is ethical and legal. Assuming we are using this data for academic or personal use, there shouldn't be any legal issues. If you plan to use this data in a commercial or business setting you should reach out to the author of the site to get permission to use this data.

### 2. Decide what data we would like included

Once you have determined that this data is okay to pull, we need to decide what specific data we would like to include from the site. First find the data you would like to include from the webpage, then right click on it, and select inspect.
#Insert image of example data and inspect box
Now that we know what data we would like to include, let's copy the url of the page into our code and use BeautifulSoup, the Python package, to organize the HTML we are pulling from the webpage.

### 3. Find HTML Tags

Now that we have the HTML from the site, we need to determine what specific data we would like to include from the site. Using inspect as mentioned previously, we can find what tags are associated with the data on the webpage. With the NBA players data we want to pull, we will need to first find the tags for the url of the webpage with the players data from each draft
#Include picture of URL in HTML
Because the site only gives the second portion of the URL we will need to join it on to the end of the original URL.
#Code joining these together
Now that we are able to access the data of each NBA draft, we need to figure out the tags for each of the rows and columns. We will use the inspect tool again to do this.
#Screenshot of some of the tags
We find that each row has it's own tag, and within that we can find the data for each column. Write these down, as they will be key in the next step. 

### 4. Loop through and pull data

Now that we have these HTML tags and the URLs of each page, we can loop through them to pull the data we want for our dataframe. Tools like find_all that are included in the BeautifulSoup package make this much easier.

### 5. Pull to a dataframe

Now that we have our data, let's pull it into a dataframe.

Doing this will allow us to analyze the data we have pulled. Think of all that this allows us to do, we know how to pull data from websites, now we can use these numbers to make better decisions and better predictions. We'll go over how to analyze this data in my next blog post
