# Beautiful Soup and Fantasy Football

Have you ever visited a website and thought, “Wow, it would be cool to analyze the data being presented!”? The Python library Beautiful Soup makes this possible. Beautiful Soup allows you to scrape data from websites, and pull it into python to be used how you would like. Whether you want to do your own analysis for fantasy football or confirm statistics you hear in the news, this package can make things easier.

### What is Beautiful Soup

As stated previously, Beautiful Soup is a python library used for scraping data from websites, or more specifically HTML and XML files that can be pulled from websites. While it can be used in various ways, such as navigating or modifying text we’ll focus more on how to use Beautiful Soup to pull data from a website into a .csv file that we can easily use for our own analysis. 

### Scraping the Data
The first step in pulling data into an organized format is to find the URL of the page you want to scrape data from and assign it to a variable in python. In some situations you will need information from several pages, in this case, you can add a parameter that will loop through the pages for you. In this example, we’ll be pulling data from several pages of fantasy football players found on ESPN.

```python
site_url = "https://fantasy.espn.com/football/players/add?leagueId=2758927"
```

Next, we need to load the packages required to parse the document we just loaded. Importing the package response will allow us to store the data pulled from the website specified. The package pandas will be used to create a dataframe, and store the data pulled within it. Pandas will also be useful later for running different analysis as many statistical functions are written into it. Requests is a package that facilitates the process of requesting data in Python, and Beautiful Soup is the package that pieces the HTML files into something legible

```python
from urllib import response
import pandas as pd
import requests as req
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
```

We now need to identify the class names from the HTML that store the data we want to view. I found it easiest to open Developer Tools, click on HTML, then use ctrl + f and type in a piece of the data.

Next, we write a function to scrape the information we want. This function will parse through the HTML pulled from the page and find the pertinent data.

```python
def scraper():
    for i in range(1,5): #We're just grabbing the information of the players from the first 5 pages
        page_stats = []
        page = "?page="+str(i)
        url = site_url + page
        response = req.get(url)
        soup = bs(response.content, 'html.parser')
        players = soup.findAll("div",attrs={"class","Table__TBODY"})
    
    for j in range(len(players)):
        page_stats.append(players[j].find("p").text)
    
    for k in range(len(page_stats)):
        player_stats.append(page_stats[k])
        return player_stats
```

### Storing the Data

After parsing through the data, we now want to pull it into a data frame. We will use the package pandas to create and modify the data.

```python
stats = scraper()
i = range(1, len(stats)+1)
stats_df = pd.DataFrame({'stat':stats}, index=i)
stats_df.to_csv('stats.csv',sep=',')
```

Now that we have the data organized, we can run all sorts of different analyses!

### Conclusion
While scraping data from a website may feel like a daunting task, the package Beautiful Soup makes it manageable. Becoming familiar with this package simplifies many seemingly complex processes, saves hours of work, and if you’re lucky can give you an edge against your friends in fantasy football.
